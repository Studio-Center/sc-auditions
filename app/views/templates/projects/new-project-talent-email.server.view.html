	<p>To submit auditions click this link:<br>
	<a href="http://remote.studiocenter.com:8000">http://remote.studiocenter.com:8000</a></p>

	<p>Then enter the username:   scauds</p>

	<p>Leave the password blank and click Log In.</p>

	<p>Drag your MP3 files, one at a time, into the center of the browser window.  You will see them listed in the window as you do.  Once they all are there, click Begin Upload. That's it!</p>

	<p>You will see a progress counter as they upload and when they are done you will see a confirmation screen telling you if they were successfully received or not.  If it says that the upload was successful, that's it!  We have your audition!<br>
	Itâ€™s extremely important that you name your MP3 files carefully.  So please make sure any audition you upload to us uses the following naming scheme:</p>

	<p>AuditionTitle-PartName-YourName</p>

	<p>So if your name is Dave Smith and you did the audition for the announcer on a spot for Home Depot, you would call the file:</p>

	<p>HomeDepot-Anncr-DaveSmith</p>

	<p>And if there is more than 1 script, you will need to provide separate files for each and designate them with the script names.</p>

	<p>HomeDepot-Script 1-Anncr-DaveSmith<br>
	HomeDepot-Script 2-Anncr-DaveSmith</p>

	<p>As well, when reading for multiple parts, submit separate, edited files for each part. See below</p>

	<p>HomeDepot-Anncr-DaveSmith<br>
	HomeDepot-Salesman-DaveSmith</p>
